# Jupyter & React

---

# A crazy idea

- Jupyter and Python are great for data-science
- React is great for interactive data-visualization

## Let's merge everything!

---

# Different challenges

- How can we communicate between Python & React?
- Jupyter widgets are in BackboneJS, but I want React!
- We don't have CommonJS import

```js
import React from "react" // not possible
```

# Let's go!

# Next steps

- Import @operational/visualization
- Export all this mess in a proper standalone widget (npm package)
- Create amazing visualization!
